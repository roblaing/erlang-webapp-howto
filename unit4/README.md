<h1>Unit 4: User authentication</h1>

If you are starting this project afresh instead of continuing from Unit 3, make the necessary edits to
<a href="https://github.com/roblaing/erlang-webapp-howto/blob/master/unit4/rebar.config">rebar.config</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/roblaing/erlang-webapp-howto/blob/master/unit4/config/sys.config">config/sys.config</a>, and the
<a href="https://github.com/roblaing/erlang-webapp-howto/blob/master/unit4/apps/unit1/src/unit4.app.src">application resource file</a>.

It also requires the following table in your database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users 
  ( id     TEXT PRIMARY KEY
  , name   TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
  , email  TEXT
  );
```

Note there is no field for password in this table because passwords should never be seen let alone stored in plain text by web servers â€” an elementary part of online security, yet stories keep appearing of big corporations storing passwords in plain text to get stolen by criminals.

The idea of this series of tutorials is to lead to a fully fledged blog. When you arrive at Facebook or Twitter,
you don't want to have to log in every time. So when you point your browser to `http://localhost:3030`  
and are already logged in (ie your cookie is set and correct) it should redirect you to your personal home page (which is just the same
welcome page as in <a href="https://github.com/roblaing/erlang-webapp-howto/tree/master/unit2">Unit 2</a> at this stage).

If you are not logged in, it should redirect you to a login form. This needs to provide you with an option of signing up
if you don't already have an account.

You don't want to remain logged in on a public computer, so a logout option is needed.
This can be done with a static 
<a href="https://github.com/roblaing/erlang-webapp-howto/blob/master/unit4/apps/unit4/priv/logout.html">logout.html</a> page 
which clears the cookie and redirects back to the login page.

<h2>Hashing</h2>

We avoid the password ever leaving the browser by using a hash created by Javascript's 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest">SubtleCrypto.digest()</a>
on the user's browser created from their login name, password, and <em>salt</em> we store in a hidden field in our HTML.
This creates a gibberish string (which bad guys will be unable to recreate the password from) which is stored as a cookie
in the browser. The server can then use this cookie to authenticate that the person has entered their correct username and password
without ever seeing the password.

This means the user's password never leaves their browser for bad guys to intercept <em>en route</em> to our server.
But we can't simply store this hash as the id in our database because if anyone breaks in and copies it, they could set it as
a cookie on their browser to masquerade as the user. So the hash created by Javascript in the browser needs to get rehashed
using functions in OTP's <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/crypto.html">crypto</a> library.

The important thing is that the same combination of login and password must create the same unique gibberish for the server
to authenticate the user with. 

As with my SWI Prolog version of this tutorial, I'm going to use John Smith as the username and Password1 as the password.

Once this user is registered and logged in, the browser cookie should be

```js
user_id=aca87862328161c8d5cc6b95d29c04401df3d4496001ba54748fed7719834a0c
```

and the database id should be

```
21b07bc6c590b4b826d8786b837c859e740d9d1a1e9cbfdfcc3c05c299f5f62d
```

Both are strings containing hexadecimals. The Javascript functions `hexString(buffer)` and `digestMessage(message)` to create
the cookie are in my 
<a href="https://github.com/roblaing/erlang-webapp-howto/blob/master/unit4/apps/unit4/priv/scripts/login.js">
apps/unit4/priv/scripts/login.js</a> file and based on Mozilla's
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest">examples</a>.

The options listed for <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/crypto.html#mac-4">
mac(Type, SubType, Key, Data) -> Mac | descriptive_error()</a> are exhaustive, but I couldn't find a builtin
Erlang function to translate the `Mac` binary (called a `digest` by hashing libraries) into a hexadecimal string.

Luckily a Google search revealed someone on  
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3768197/erlang-ioformatting-a-binary-to-hex">stackoverflow</a> had written
a nifty list comprehension for me to cut 'n paste.

I put the function below in my `webutil` module file. Since it's only used by the `logged_in(Req)` function coming up next,
I didn't add it to the export list.

```erlang
-spec create_hash(Input::binary()) -> Hexdigest :: string().
%% @doc Rehash the hexdigest read from browser cookie and return as a new hexdigest.
create_hash(Binary) ->
  Salt = "Some very long randomly generated string",
  Bin = crypto:mac(hmac, sha256, Salt, Binary),
  [begin if N < 10 -> 48 + N; true -> 87 + N end end || <<N:4>> <= Bin].
```

<h2>Routing</h2>

My routing section in <a href="https://github.com/roblaing/erlang-webapp-howto/blob/master/unit4/apps/unit4/src/unit4_app.erl">
apps/unit4/src/unit4_app.erl</a> looks like this:

```erlang
  Dispatch = cowboy_router:compile(
   [{'_', 
     [ {"/"              , welcome_or_login, []}
     , {"/login"         , login_handler, []}
     , {"/signup"        , signup_handler, []}
     , {"/welcome/:name" , welcome_handler, []}
     , {"/logout"        , cowboy_static, {priv_file, unit4, "logout.html"}}
     , {"/styles/[...]"  , cowboy_static, {priv_dir,  unit4, "styles"}}
     , {"/scripts/[...]" , cowboy_static, {priv_dir,  unit4, "scripts"}}
     ] 
    }
   ]
  ),
```

<h3>Reading cookies</h3>

Back to the <a href="https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.2/guide/req/">Req</a> Erlang 
<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/maps.html">map</a> that cowboy handlers' init/2 receive
as their first argument.

```erlang
#{headers => #{...
  <<"cookie">> =>
    <<"user_id=aca87862328161c8d5cc6b95d29c04401df3d4496001ba54748fed7719834a0c">>,
  ...}
}
```

Checking if a user is logged in requires a three step series of checks:

 1. Is there a `<<"cookie">>` key in the headers map? If no cookie is set, the user is not logged in.
 2. Even if there is a cookie string, it could be junk put there by advertisers or browser plugins.
    The semicolon separated text list of key1=value1; key2=value2,... 
    needs to be parsed to find if there is a "user_id=". If there's no such key, the user is not logged in.
 3. Even if there is a "user_id=Hash", the Hash may not translate into a valid Id in the database, in which
    case the Hash was created from a wrong user name or password, so the user is not be logged in.

To work through this fairly convoluted logic, I've written the following auxiliary function which
either returns a string with the user's name from the database or false.

```erlang
-spec logged_in(Req0::cowboy_req:req()) -> Name::string() | false.
%% @doc if the user is logged in, return their name, else return false.
logged_in(Req0) ->
  HeadersMap = maps:get(headers, Req0),
  AreCookiesSet = maps:is_key(<<"cookie">>, HeadersMap),
  if 
    AreCookiesSet ->
      CookieString = binary:bin_to_list(maps:get(<<"cookie">>, HeadersMap)),
      case string:find(CookieString, "user_id=", leading) of
          nomatch -> false;
          IdStart ->
            case string:find(IdStart, ";") of
              nomatch -> [_, Hash]      = string:split(IdStart, "=");
              _       -> [UpToColon, _] = string:split(IdStart, ";"),
                         [_, Hash]      = string:split(UpToColon, "=")
            end,
            Query = io_lib:format("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id='~s'", [create_hash(Hash)]),
            QueryMap = pgo:query(Query),
            case maps:get(num_rows, QueryMap) of
              0 -> false;
              1 -> [{Name}] = maps:get(rows, QueryMap), Name
            end
      end;
    true -> false
  end.
```

I don't have to bother escaping single quotes since the string inserted into the SQL query
is generated by create_hash/1, so any malicious SQL-injection attack read from a cookie would have gotten turned into
a string whose characters are limited to numbers `0` to `9` and letters `a` to `f`.
